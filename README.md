## Getting Started

```bash
# Resolve dependencies
yarn install

# Run the Vue development server
yarn serve
```

# Config
In the file structure you will find a api_config.json, which is looking like that:
``bash
{
    # pass your apiUrl here e.g. http://localhost:5000
    "apiUrl": "",
    # pass your generated authToken here
    "authToken" : ""
}

```
There is a config interface for this config, so you can get proper auto completion.
An example usage is in the deployment service.
